                    <p>
                        In order to have a peace and order , the people must feel that they are free from threat or danger.That is why Barangay Bayan Park Village installed a total of four CCTVs in order to monitor their barangay. They are also planning to install seven more CCTVs in order to cover their whole barangay. They also send two brangay tanods together with the police to patrol the area. The barangay tanods are equiped with batuta and flashlight.
