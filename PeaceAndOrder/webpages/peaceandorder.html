                                We live in a society where crimes can happen anywhere at anytime. Crimes can be theft, rape or even murdere. That is why we want to feel a sense of security and in order to fulfill this sense of security, maintaining and implementing the peace and order is essential to all places. Barangay Bayan Park Village installed a total of four CCT's in order to monitor what is happening and to be able to response immediately if something happens. They are also planning to install seven more CCTV's in order to cover the whole barangay. Installing the CCTV's is not enough to maintain security that is why there are two tanods who patrol the area equiped with a batuta and a flashlight starting at 10:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. The police also helps in the patrolling the barangay.
