                            In order to have a peace and order , the people must feel that they are free from threat or danger.That is why Barangay Bayan Park Village installed a total of four CCTVs in order to monitor their barangay. They are also planning to install seven more CCTVs in order to cover their whole barangay. They also send two brangay tanods together with the police to patrol the area. The barangay tanods are equiped with batuta and flashlight. There is one or two police officers which is sent to patrol for the barangay, this police officer is usually on foot but sometimes they use police mobile. This police officers are equipped with flashlight, guns and handcuffs.

                            There are 10 accidents or crime that occurred in Bayan Park Village during the year 2017, which is fewer compared to other barangays here in baguio. Most of this are physical injuries and child abuse. There is also a violation of RA 9165 which is related to drugs on January 2017. There are also Violence against women, unjust vexation, and reckless imprudence resuting damage to properties (RIRDTP). This is why only 2 police officers are being sent in their barangay since crime doesn't take place here often.
