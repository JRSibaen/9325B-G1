                            There are 10 accidents or crime that occurred in Bayan Park Village during the year 2017, which is fewer compared to other barangays here in baguio. Most of this are physical injuries and child abuse. There is also a violation of RA 9165 which is related to drugs on January 2017. There are also Violence against women, unjust vexation, and reckless imprudence resuting damage to properties (RIRDTP). This is why only 2 police officers are being sent in their barangay since crime doesn't take place here often.

                        <p>Bayan Park Village, in order to maintain the order in the barangay, the barangay also implemented the same ordinance that the baguio city implemented. Some of this is the curfew which is already stated above which is City Ordinance No. 50. There is also no parking for the side of the road which can cause traffic since the side of the road is being block making it narrow (BARANGAY ORDINANCE 003-08).</p>
