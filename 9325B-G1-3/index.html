                <p>
                    Bayan Park Village is conducting a monthly cleaning drive every last week of the month. This drive aims to keep the village free of diseases and pests. They used to put garbage cans on the streets but it was being stolen so what they did was remove the garbage cans and conduct cleaning of the streets once or twice a week to keep the streets clean.

                <p>
                    Bayan Park Village has a project called tree planting project. They plant trees in the village to preserve or help the environment. though they did not tell us where they get the seeds for the planting it could be very well coming from the government or their village funds, either way this movement of theirs will hopefully be mimicked by other barangays in the area.

                <h3>Discussion</h3>
                <p>
                    The Capitan said that "Barangay Park Village is only upholding and implementing the rules of Baguio City". Although they are only implementing the already existing rules in their barangay, this can greatly impact the people that are living in the area. Since the rules are directly specified in their area, they are most likely to follow the rules
