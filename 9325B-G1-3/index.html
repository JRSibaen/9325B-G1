                    <p>
                    Bayan Park Village has a project called tree planting project. They plant trees in the village to preserve or help the environment. though they did not tell us where they get the seeds for the planting it could be very well coming from the government or their village funds, either way this movement of theirs will hopefully be mimicked by other barangays in the area.
