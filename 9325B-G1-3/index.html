            <h1>General Cleaning</h1>
            <p>
                Bayan Park Village is conducting a monthly cleaning drive every last week of the month. This drive aims to keep the village free of diseases and pests. They used to put garbage cans on the streets but it was being stolen so what they did was remove the garbage cans and conduct cleaning of the streets once or twice a week to keep the streets clean.

            <h1>Tree Planting</h1>
            <p>
                Bayan Park Village has a project called tree planting project. They plant trees in the village to preserve or help the environment. though they did not tell us where they get the seeds for the planting it could be very well coming from the government or their village funds, either way this movement of theirs will hopefully be mimicked by other barangays in the area.

            <h1>Migrating to GREEN</h1>
            <p>
                Bayan Park Village is already starting the say no to plastic ordinance. This ordinance aims to remove all plastic bags in the village and convert to paper bags. This is to help the environment to lessen the use of plastic in their area. Anyone caught using plastics in their stores will be given a warning, if they do it again there will be a penalty, in the fourth time that the owner got caught will have his or her business shut down by getting their business permit.

            <h1>Discussion</h1>
            <p>
                The Capitan said that "Barangay Park Village is only upholding and implementing the rules of Baguio City". Although they are only implementing the already existing rules in their barangay, this can greatly impact the people that are living in the area. Since the rules are directly specified in their area, they are most likely to follow the rules
